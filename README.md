### 🔥 About this project

As I'm learning the basic and before using framework like tailwind I had to refresh my skills and CSS, the goal of this project #3 was to have a 'heavy' design with a mix between flex / grid

Nothing fancy, just practicing grid and getting the feeling for it.

---

### Features

- ▶︎ Learning complex layout (Flex / Grid)
- ▶︎ Index Page
